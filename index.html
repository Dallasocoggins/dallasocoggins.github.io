                <p class="date"><strong>Feb 2024</strong> - <strong>Feb 2024</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Plugged In is a fast-paced 2D platformer where players control a nimble robot 
                    equipped with a grappling hook that plugs into electrical "outlets" scattered 
                    throughout the levels. These outlets charge the robot's battery, granting it 
                    the ability to perform powerful platforming maneuvers such as double jumps, 
                    dashes, and ground slams. Mastering the balance between movement and energy 
                    management is key to navigating the game's dynamic environments.
                </p>
                <p>    
                    Developed in just 48 hours for Chillennium 2024, Plugged In was a 
                    collaborative effort between a team of fourâ€”two artists and two programmers. 
                    I contributed by designing gameplay mechanics, scripting core movement and 
                    abilities in C#, and crafting engaging level layouts. The game's 
                    innovative mechanics and polished execution earned it first place 
                    among the competition's many entries.

                <p class="date"><strong>Feb 2025</strong></p>
                <p>
                    In the Chillennium 2025 game jam, for the theme "In Plain Sight," my team and I created a horror 2D platformer in just under 48 hours. 
                    I took the lead in designing the gameplay and levels while also writing C# scripts to implement core game mechanics. 
                    The game focuses on a girl named "Who," who is being chased by a terrifying monster. The monster is incredibly fast but freezes when exposed to the light.
                    The player controls Who and her light in her attempt to find her escape from the monster while managing her light resources.
                    For this game, I collaborated with a team of 3 others: 2 artists and 1 programmer.
                    We earned third place out of around 50 submissions.

                <h4>Calamity Crew</h4>
                <p class="date"><strong>2024</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Calamity Crew is a cooperative multiplayer game developed with the 
                    LIVE Lab, where players work together to rescue survivors trapped 
                    under rubble on a flooding island. As the water rises, teamwork and 
                    quick decision-making become essential to navigate the environment 
                    and save as many people as possible before time runs out.  
                    I played a key role in developing the game's peer-to-peer multiplayer 
                    system, ensuring smooth and responsive online gameplay. This involved 
                    implementing replication strategies to synchronize player actions, 
                    optimizing network serialization to minimize bandwidth usage and 
                    latency, and designing authoritative game logic to prevent 
                    cheating and maintain game state consistency.  
                    Through a combination of engaging cooperative mechanics and polished 
                    networking, **Calamity Crew** delivers an immersive multiplayer 
                    experience that challenges players to work together under pressure.

                <h4>Reliable Data Transfer over UDP</h4>
                <p class="date"><strong>Apr 2024</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Reliable Data Transfer over UDP is a CSCE 463, Networks and Distributed Processing, 
                    project in which I implemented 
                    a custom Reliable Data Transfer (RDT) protocol on top of UDP to ensure ordered, 
                    lossless communication between networked systems. Unlike TCP, UDP does not 
                    guarantee reliable delivery, so this project involved designing and implementing 
                    retransmission mechanisms using acknowledgments and sequence numbers to handle 
                    packet loss, corruption, and out-of-order delivery.
                    To test the protocol's resilience, I simulated network conditions with varying 
                    levels of packet loss and latency, refining the retransmission logic for 
                    efficiency. This project deepened my understanding of low-level networking, 
                    socket programming, and transport-layer protocols, reinforcing key concepts 
                    in network reliability and performance optimization.

                <h4>C++ Web Crawler</h4>
                <p class="date"><strong>Feb 2024</strong></p>
                <p>
                    For CSCE 463, I developed a high-performance web crawler capable of 
                    processing URLs from an input file and asynchronously fetching web 
                    content. The crawler was designed with parallelized HTTP requests 
                    using multithreading, significantly improving page retrieval 
                    efficiency.
                    To ensure scalability and avoid redundant processing, I implemented 
                    a URL queueing and deduplication system, preventing duplicate 
                    requests and optimizing memory usage. The project enhanced my 
                    understanding of low-level networking, concurrent programming, 
                    and distributed systems, providing hands-on experience with socket 
                    programming and HTTP communication protocols.
